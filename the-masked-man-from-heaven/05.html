<p>Evdaimonia had handed Ergodotis a sprig of wine, which he brought back to the palace.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that only a sprig?&quot; Doulos inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Be grateful that the queen didn&#39;t murder me.&quot; Ergodotis poured himself a glass of wine. Even though he could have eaten them right away, Doulos only took ready-made ones. The drink was ready, however, the color was a little faded. &quot;Isn&#39;t this wine past its prime?&quot; Ergodotis continued to think clearly.</p>

<p>He opened the letter he had hidden earlier before handing it over to the king. He comprehended Evdaimonia&#39;s point after reading it. On the one hand, he was grateful for the pleasant surprise that this water queen had bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had to risk the biggest one being murdered right then and then.</p>

<p>Doulos was presented with a new crystal glass filled with wine. He took a sip and spit it right in Ergodotis&#39; face. &quot;What exactly is this? Sour!&quot;</p>

<p>Evdaimonia was the one who had cast the wine. The grapes were not yet entirely mature, but the spell transformed them into ripe grapes.</p>

<p>Ergodotis smirked as he swiped the letter across his happy face. Then Doulos read it. He appears enraged before burning it with his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;That crown....&quot; says the speaker. Ergodotis grumbled. That&#39;s when he discovered where his power stemmed from.</p>

<p>He finally realized why his former slave had chosen to become the king of fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Go send our troops! They&#39;re requesting a war!&quot;</p>
