<p>Philikos, the king of fire, and Kalos, the king of water, were never adversaries, according to history. The vendors selling at the border exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>Coal and charcoal are produced in the fire nation. Mine carriage&#39;s rails are completely stretched. Those who produce swords and armor, armor and jewelry. It&#39;s no surprise that this country has grown so powerful.</p>

<p>The country of the sea is a suburban one. Agriculture and plantations abound across its enormous landmass. It can also be found in a number of places, some of which are even administered by the fire nation community.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon for people to talk about Fotia, the princess of the fire kingdom, at the market. They merely know the name and don&#39;t bother to look.</p>

<p>Filikos established himself as a strict father by refusing to let him leave the palace until the scheduled time.</p>

<p>They compared themselves to Gennaios, the water prince who had vanished into thin air. Between those who do not desire self, there is a strong idea that he is only transient.</p>

<p>Gennaios is well-known in both countries for his generosity in the marketplace. He&#39;s frequently seen pushing a mining cart and standing in one of the stores, assisting with the sale of farm produce.</p>

<p>&quot;Evdaimonia has no right to be queen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Gennaios had still been alive, I would have made him king!&quot;</p>

<p>When Doulos declared himself king of fire, the peace was broken.</p>

<p>People&#39;s negative thoughts are sparked temporarily by the belief that the water nation is to blame for what is currently occurring.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Gennaios was the supplier of the wine that Doulos had always enjoyed, his business was demolished. Doulos was caught stealing a number of times, but Gennaios always forgave him.</p>
