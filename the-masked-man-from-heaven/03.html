<p>On the throne, Doulos said, &quot;Waiter!&quot; The sound of his voice reverberated throughout the palace.</p>

<p>A servant rushes up to him. Ergodotis is his name, and she was sadly Doulos&#39; master when he was enslaved. The situation has now been reversed.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s the matter, king?&quot; the waiter inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Where&#39;s the wine?&quot; Doulos responded, holding a crystal cup. He appears enraged.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s no longer any of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seek out more!&quot;</p>

<p>Ergodotis then exited the palace and headed towards the border on horseback, holding the improvised money the king had given him.</p>

<p>When he arrived, he was astounded to discover that Gennaios&#39; shop, where he was known as the best wine merchant in town, had been demolished.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened to this establishment? Why was it obliterated?&quot; Ergodotis, perplexed, inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;He who sells wine in this town has long since vanished. Anyone who hasn&#39;t traded in a long time, according to the fire lord&#39;s rules, must have their business demolished. We are merely executing commands.&quot;</p>

<p>Ergodotis saw another shop close, but it&#39;s safe to say that the wine there isn&#39;t similar in terms of quality or pricing.</p>

<p>&quot;What? How about a hundred coins?&quot; Ergodotis, perplexed, inquired again.</p>

<p>&quot;That merchant got twenty-five coins for it, and that was a wonderful deal.&quot; Ergodotis was reduced to mumbling. He returned to the palace with two stalks, which he squeezed and presented to Doulos right away. Doulos merely took a single sip before spitting it out.</p>

<p>&quot;What exactly is this? This isn&#39;t the same as before.&quot;</p>

<p>Ergodotis only told him what had happened after that. Doulos then gave the order to go to the water country and find an excellent wine.</p>

<p>Ergodotis resumed driving with a specific destination in mind. He came across a vineyard that he thought was promising and plundered some of it. He snatched it and stuffed it inside a bag.</p>

<p>The people of the water nation caught Ergodotis and surrounded him. In a nutshell, he was apprehended and taken to the palace. What happened was briefly stated by a member of the community.</p>

<p>Queen Evdaimonia mumbled, &quot;Perhaps if Gennaios had been present, he wouldn&#39;t have forgiven you either.&quot;</p>

<p>The Queen inquired, &quot;What made you steal our wine?&quot; She screamed louder this time.</p>

<p>&quot;I was summoned by King Doulos.&quot;</p>
