<p>Nation of Fire and Water. The two neighboring kingdoms were formerly tranquil, but that is no longer true.</p>

<p>It all started when Doulos, a slave who had previously worked in both kingdoms, slew the Filya King of Fire, and Kalos King of Water. So that no one would suspect him, he made himself a king of fire and made Evdaimonia a queen in The Nation of Water.</p>

<p>Many people are unaware of what occurred to their former ruler, so his acts appear smooth.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the former queen of the fire has been dead for a long time, and Princess Fotia cannot succeed his parents as a leader due to restrictions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Water Prince&#39;s Gennaios vanished without a trace. Evdaimonia, his mother and the kingdom&#39;s queen, even sponsored a competition to find him.</p>

<p>The resurgence of Doulos, who now rules the fire nation, transformed the country into an authoritarian monarchy that significantly impacted the community, including the fire nation next door. To Doulos&#39; delight, border trade is even monopolized.</p>

<p>Doulos, in particular, is a drinker who, even as a slave, enjoys imbibing large amounts of alcohol.</p>
