<p>The masked man is now on the battleground. He brought his bow and arrows, and he pulled up the tree whose top had been charred by lightning.</p>

<p>The trumpet is blown, and the sound reverberates. The conflict began with a ferocious attack by the soldiers of the Fire Nation.</p>

<p>The sound of swords clashing shook the atmosphere. The masked man grabbed his blade from his belt and began fighting as well.</p>

<p>Doulos was worried at the top of the fort after seeing his warriors fall into the hands of the disguised man. He took out a book and opened it. It appears to contain a spell employed frequently by the late Kalos.</p>

<p>Fotia turned out to be there and managed to catch him and then ran.</p>

<p>Doulos took off his face shield to go down, &quot;It&#39;s you!&quot; He tries to command his warriors to assault Fota, who is attempting to flee.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Take a look! &quot;The masked man yelled.</p>

<p>The now-exposed Doulos was struck by an arrow. He appeared to be in pain and sought to take it out as he continued to retreat till he died after falling from the top of the fort.</p>

<p>The trumpet rang out once more. It should have signified the end of the conflict and the victory of the water country.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you tell me who you are?&quot; Ergodotis inquired.</p>

<p>The man removed his mask. &quot;Gennaios!&quot; Evdaimonia rushes forward to embrace him. Gennaios smiled as he gazed at Fotia.</p>

<p>&quot;Kaine to!&quot; says Kalos. Kalos&#39; crown was struck by an arrow that fell from the top of the fort.</p>

<p>Fotia waved at Gennaios after putting the crown on her head. &quot;Troops! Assemble! &quot;He gave the order as he walked towards the palace.</p>
