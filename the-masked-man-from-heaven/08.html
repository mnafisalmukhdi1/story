<p>The man called out to his horse with a whistle. The man was pursued by a white horse. They continued to run until the man mounted his horse.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I saw that horse, but who&#39;s it?&quot; enquired a resident of the water nation.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Fotia was combing her hair in the room. Suddenly, a man smashed the door open and walked in. Fotia was ready to scream when she realized she couldn&#39;t since her mouth was covered.</p>

<p>&quot;Take it easy, you know who I am.&quot; He was the previous runner. I&#39;m not sure how to get to the fire palace.</p>

<p>Fotia was taken aback when he wiped the leaves from his cheeks. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d like to hide for a bit. What happened to your father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My father was murdered by Doulos. He has now ascended to the throne.&quot;</p>

<p>Fotia appears enraged.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for the inconvenience. What happened to him?&quot;</p>

<p>Fotia said quickly, &quot;On the stronghold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did he end up there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a war with the water nation,&quot; says Fotia.</p>

<p>On Fotia&#39;s table, the man noticed something. &quot;Whose is it?&quot; says him, pointing to a blue eye mask.</p>

<p>&quot;It used to be mine, but now it isn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I ask for it?&quot; The man said, without asking why. It was given by Fotia.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you so much. Now I&#39;ll aid the water nation and get vengeance on Doulos.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is exactly how it should be. Return to your home!&quot;</p>
