<p>Ergodotis dashed over to his mount. &quot;Our monarch will go to battle with the country of the water! Prepare to be surprised! &quot;As soon as he mounted his horse, he said. Then he takes the wheel.</p>

<p>When word got out, the border market erupted into a brawl. Because they were certain that war would break out here, the merchants tidied out their stores swiftly.</p>

<p>It seemed surprising since Ergodotis continued on his way instead of returning. From a distance, he appears to be on his way to the water country&#39;s palace.</p>

<p>The guards held Ergodotis, but Evdaimonia, who had just emerged from the palace, ordered him to be released so that they might talk.</p>

<p>&quot;How did your king react?&quot; Evdaimonia inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;He appears to dislike it so much that he wishes for a kingdom-wide conflict.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;War? We&#39;d much sooner apologize and withdraw than&ndash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our people at the border have fallen, your queen!&quot; exclaimed a passing water citizen who had nearly fallen while riding a horse at a fast pace.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;ve also built a fort near the border!&quot; says the narrator. He continued and then walked away. He appears to be one of the warriors guarding the bordering water nation.</p>

<p>After that, Evdaimonia entered the palace and went inside a chamber. A table with old books sat in the room&#39;s center, flanked by many shelves of additional volumes.</p>

<p>Agios, that old book was their instruction manual.</p>

<p>Evdaimonia is confident that there is a page somewhere that will be of assistance.</p>

<p>&quot;When two brothers are at odds, We will send an anonymous mediator to assist those who have distributed goodness to mankind,&quot; according to Chapter Altheia, the second chapter.</p>

<p>The Queen recalled her husband, Kalos, imprisoning a pundit beneath the palace. At that point, he arrived with the book. &quot;You there. Our country is currently in jeopardy, and I am requesting your assistance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no desire to do so. I enjoy living here because it allows me to be more in touch with God.&quot; He suddenly averted his gaze, most likely irritated.</p>

<p>Evdaimonia remarked, &quot;If you answer my question, you will be released.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d like you to clarify what this remark from the text means.&quot; He handed the book to me.</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s the Masked Man from Heaven, as we&#39;ve come to know him. I&#39;m confident God won&#39;t take long to send him, so find him soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll set you free. However, it is entirely up to you whether or not you wish to remain here.&quot; The prison was unlocked by Evdaimonia. &quot;And let us know if you find him first.&quot;</p>
