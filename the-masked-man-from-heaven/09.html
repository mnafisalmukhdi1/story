<p>Fota exclaimed, &quot;Defeat him!&quot; The gentleman simply smiled.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&quot;I told you he was there!&quot; One of the locals kept pointing.</p>

<p>They are resting in battle and will resume after the fire nation forces blow the trumpet.</p>

<p>&quot;Master, please assist us!&quot; He stood in the way of the white horse.</p>

<p>&quot;Find me first in the aquatic palace with the king.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, he&#39;s dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It appears that I&#39;ve been gone far too long&ndash;how about the queen? Look for me with her.&quot; The man was escorted to the royal palace on the river. The citizens who accompanied him planned to return to the battleground.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Evdaimonia inquired. Ergodotis still exists.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to know who I am. I&#39;d like to meet the interpreter, and you&#39;re aware of his location.&quot;</p>

<p>Evdaimonia and the man entered the grounds of the palace. Ergodotis was right behind them.</p>

<p>&quot;You! Sir, thank you for coming. Please assist us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you tell me who he is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the man we&#39;ve been looking for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How come the individuals who brought him here earlier aren&#39;t here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s all right. What&#39;s the matter, sir? &quot;enquired the translator.</p>

<p>&quot;How can the fire king be defeated?&quot; The interpreter was deafeningly quiet.</p>

<p>&quot;Crown!&quot; Ergodotis&#39; words were unexpected. &quot;That&#39;s where the power comes from!&quot; says the narrator.</p>
