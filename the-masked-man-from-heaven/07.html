<p>Evdaimonia is hosting a new competition. If his son is named wanted, the masked man becomes most wanted, with a larger reward.</p>

<p>The interpreter overheard the news. &quot;There&#39;s no way he could be located in that manner.&quot; He just hung the key that the queen had thrown against the wall.</p>

<p>Evdaimonia concentrated on reading Agios&#39; book. They&#39;re looking for posts that will assist them. &quot;They would not have waged a war if Filikos and Gynaika were still alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it was my fault for wanting to teach Doulos a lesson but instead endangering my people.&quot;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The commander of the fire nation&#39;s castle began to take shape.</p>

<p>Although the battle had not yet officially begun, they had demolished all of the businesses in the market with large stones.</p>

<p>Of course, this is against the etiquette of battle, which is also included in Agios&#39; book.</p>

<p>Zeus, the god, appeared enraged. The sky was beginning to darken. It appears that a storm is on its way.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was a lot of rain. A tall tree on the boundary was struck by lightning.</p>

<p>Someone was thrown from the tree. Leaves were covering his face.</p>

<p>&quot;There he is!&quot; exclaimed someone, pointing to him. After that, he dashed towards the fire nation.</p>

<p>All of the arrows that were aimed at him miraculously missed him completely. He&#39;s a master at avoiding.</p>

<p>&quot;What exactly do you mean when you say it&#39;s him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the person Queen Evdaimonia is searching for.&quot;</p>
