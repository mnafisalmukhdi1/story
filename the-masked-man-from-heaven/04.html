<p>&quot;Wait, Doulos?&quot; inquired Evdaimonia, who appeared to be irritated.</p>

<p>&quot;What has he done?&quot; Ergodotis responded.</p>

<p>Everything was explained by Evdaimonia. &quot;That jerk assassinated my husband and threatened to make me queen, despite the fact that everyone knows the rules written in Agios forbid such. Fortunately, my society encourages it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since his ascension to the throne of the fire nation, other nations have refused to communicate with him. Take a look at who&#39;s presently assisting you. Aren&#39;t we?&quot; The voice of Evdaimonia was audible. He was quite enraged.</p>

<p>Because he remembered the contents of Agios&#39; book, he tried to relax. Legends and regulations are common in the Book of Agios.</p>

<p>The people of the realm of fire and water believe that they must follow all of the laws in the book in order to avoid unpleasant things happening as a result of numerous infractions.</p>

<p>&quot;How about Gynaika?&quot; says the narrator. Evdaimonia is a Greek word that means &quot;fire queen.&quot; He spoke in a low, forceful, and audible tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Her and her husband Kalos were assassinated as well. It makes me feel like it&#39;s all my fault.&quot; Evdaimonia was taken aback by Ergodotis&#39; statements.</p>

<p>&quot;What exactly do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was mistreated by me when I was his master. To acquire money, he was rented out to two kingdoms at the same time. He now repays me by appointing me as a servant in the kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The lashing made a loud noise. Doulos could only sense it from his powerless position on his knees.</p>

<p>Ergodotis overworked his willpower.</p>

<p>Until one day, the thought of assassinating the king in order to take over as ruler occurred to him. His sole goal is to exact vengeance on his lord.</p>

<p>In fact, he abused his position of authority. The people of the fire country, which he governs, do not appear to be pleased. They may sense disappointment.</p>

<p>The new monarch, believing himself to be better, turned out to be harmful to them all, notwithstanding their inability to oppose, let alone rebel.</p>

<p>The people of the fire nation frequently seek assistance from the people of the water nation. All of this was made possible by Gennaios&#39; determination to let it happen.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Evdaimonia then rose from her seat and proceeded to gather a sprig of ripe grapes. Sje then begged Ergodotis to wait while she wrote a letter to him.</p>

<p>&quot;This is for your &quot;king&quot;! He should be ashamed of himself for committing such a heinous crime.&quot;</p>
